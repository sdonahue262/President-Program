# President-Program
The program the will replace our president

This program creates a population of feed forward neural networks and trains each of them while timing how long it takes each of them to train. it the uses the number of layers divided by the training time as a fitness function to promote both convoluted and efficient networks. It sorts the population by this fitness and creates a new population of children with the genes of the most successful. I don't know if this is how any of this works.
